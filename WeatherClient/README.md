# WeatherClient
The WeatherClient class provides a connection to the OpenWeatherMap API. To use it copy the files from this folder into your Arduino sketch folder. Note that you will need to copy the Arduino JSON files too.

You will need to register at [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/). Look at the WeatherFurby code for an example of how to use it.
